# Dota 2 Hero Grapher

This started as a quick 1 hour project to see how fast I could crank it out and grew into an exploration of different frameworks and building a 1-page web app. I was happy enough with the results of my original python script that I decided to turn it into a web application so that it could be much more accessible to anyone I wanted to show it to. 

In the current iteration of this app, the main libraries I am using are [dygraphs](http://dygraphs.com/) (for building the graph) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (for making it interactive). this is my first time using either of these libraries, and I have been pleasantly surprised with the results I have seen so far.
